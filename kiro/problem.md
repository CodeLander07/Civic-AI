# The Problem: The Civic Disconnect

## 1. The Language Barrier
India is a land of many languages, but its bureaucracy often speaks only one: English (or complex formal Hindi).
- **Fact:** Less than 10% of the Indian population speaks English fluently.
- **Impact:** Millions of citizens cannot read the notices they receive or the forms they need to fill out.

## 2. The Complexity Trap
Even for those who read the language, government documents are written in "legalese"—dense, jargon-filled text that is difficult to parse.
- **Example:** A simple land notice might reference multiple sections of an act without explaining what they mean for the landowner.
- **Impact:** Fear, anxiety, and missed deadlines.

## 3. The Middleman Dependency
Because the system is opaque, citizens are forced to rely on "agents" or middlemen to navigate it.
- **Risk:** This creates a breeding ground for misinformation, exploitation, and bribery.
- **Cost:** Citizens pay for services that should be free or low-cost.

## 4. Information Fragmentation
Information about schemes (like PM Kisan, Ayushman Bharat) is scattered across hundreds of websites.
- **Result:** Eligible citizens often don't know what benefits they are entitled to.
